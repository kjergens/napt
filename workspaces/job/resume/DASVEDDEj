Hi Chastity,

On the ride home tonight I remembered a few more conversations Vladik and I had. I thought you'd need to know. Maybe it explains his behavior better. We can discuss if you like. In the meantime, here's what I can remember:

Jan 29th - I saw V. with new girl. Got upset. Didn't talk to anyone for a few days.
Feb 3  - I talked to you.
Feb 4 - I talked to V. about what I saw. Things ended in a friendly way.
Feb 5 - Work social. I saw V. at the bar with his same girl. She upset at sight of me, runs out. He tells me I'm making things hard, also runs out. All of us were upset.
I move my seat.
Feb 4 (Saturday) - V and I talked on the phone re. what happened at the bar. The conversation got heated at some point, but it ended friendly.
Feb 6 - Despite ending our phone convo in a friendly way, things at the office still tense. I asked if we can talk at our old hang-out to wrap up the relationship and see if we can be friends. I later changed my mind, and we decided over IM that we'd just be friends.
Feb 7 - Despite the friendly IM, he v. cold to me - ran away from me, shoots looks between me and the other girl. I get upset.
Feb 9 - Work social. I'm crying in a bar. Matt B. sees me. I talk to Matt about it for the first time.
Feb 10 - Matt and I talk in the office about it. He says he'll say something to V. but I said I'll give it one more try.
Feb 12 - I talk to V. and he says to leave him alone.
I don't talk to Vladik for a long time. I work from home a lot.

Apr 2 - Vladik approaches me in the bar. This was the conversation I just talked to you about. He approached me 2 other times that night.
